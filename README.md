# Rooftop Review

see project live at https://rooftopreview.herokuapp.com/

## Purpose
<p> I want to eventually make this project a platform like Yelp but is specifically for rooftop bars and cafes. </p>
<p>This web application will enable rooftop enthusiasts to read about, rate, review, and write blogs about thousands of rooftop places across the world. The web app will also suggest users rooftop places and reviews based on their locations. I am constantly working on the project to make these features possible. </p>

## Current Features
<ul>
  
  <li>A responsive web app for reviewing rooftop bars with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Features including creating reviews/ratings/blog posts, user authentication and authorization,
location display with Google Maps API and fuzzy searching</li>

</ul>
